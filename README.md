# pandas-challenge

This ReadMe serves to:
   1. Certify that this work is my own,
   2. Specify code source and its location in my 'pandas-challenge' repository,
   3. Clarify the reason for the assignment,

1. 
My name is Brittney Watts, and I am in the UNCC/EdX Data Analytics Bootcamp. Currently, we 
are working on Module 3 of our exploration into the Python programming languange in VSCode.

2. 
The source code is my interpretation of the information we have learned in class with some debugging help from forums, and here
is a breakdown of the locations of each element of my assignment:

   pandas-challenge
      PyCitySchools
         Resources
            schools_complete.csv
            students_complete.csv
         main.ipynb(my code)
         Analysis.txt
      README.md

3. 
This assignment serves to track my understanding of Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and the Python Language.

PyCitySchools:
   My task was to read the data from the csv files and perform operations on them to analyze schools' and their students' performances based on certain factors.
   The schools_complete.csv file gives us surface level data, and the students_complete.csv file gives us performance data to analyze based on the information given in the schools_complete.csv file.
   
   My Steps: 
      - First, I had to calculate the total number of schools, students, the total budget, the average math and reading scores, the percentage of students who passed math, reading, math AND reading, and create a dataframe to summarize all of this information.
      - Find the school names, school types, students per school, total budgets per school, the average math and reading scores per school, and calculate the percentage of students who passed math, reading, and math AND reading, then create a dataframe to summarize the information broken down by the individual schools.
      - Find and display the highest and lowest performing schools based on the percentage of students who were passing both math and reading.
      - Calculate the math and reading scores for each grade, and summarize them into a dataframe. 
      - Calculate the students' scores based upon the amount of funding the schools allocate to each child. 
      - Calculate the students' scores based on their school size (number of students) and their school types (district or charter).
      - The last step is to summarize my data and make a few conclusions which you can find in my "Analysis.txt" file!!!
      
THANK YOU!!!!!
